      "\n                                  I searched high and low for a recipe for this delicious pastry, originally prepared only for the aristocratic Renaissance set in Italy. There are only a few recipes online in English, and they assume you know quite about bit about baking or were just wrong. I've tried to simplify the process. It's a challenging recipe that requires a lot of time and some special techniques. Don't be upset if you don't get it right the first time. NOTE: The dough is a formula, so the ingredient measures are weights. It matters. The rest is less critical, so I used volumes.\n                                ",

Even my brother, who hates onions and celery, loved this.  Because it makes so much, we tend to cook it only on the holidays. It takes a while to cook, but it is delicious and simple.\n                                ",
